# Morgan [aka. Project Presidium]
An infamously named chatbot built with [Slack Bolt](https://github.com/slackapi/bolt-js). 

Requirements:
- Docker
- Node.js & npm

Good to know: Use [Loophole.cloud](https://loophole.cloud/) as a tunnel for the app to communicate with Slack. Alternative to Ngrok that lets you set a custom subdomain for free.
